# 🚀 Cloudflare Pages Deployment - GitHub Integration

## Issue Fixed ✅

The deployment issue has been resolved! The problem was that Cloudflare Pages wasn't running the build command to create the `dist` folder.

**✅ Fixed**: Added `build.command: "npm run build"` to `wrangler.jsonc`

## Updated Configuration

Your `wrangler.jsonc` now includes:
```json
{
  "name": "cas-dashboard-v2", 
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-27",
  "pages_build_output_dir": "./dist",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "build": {
    "command": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Retry Deployment

Now that the configuration is fixed and pushed to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages should automatically:

1. **Clone the repository** ✅
2. **Run `npm install`** ✅ 
3. **Run `npm run build`** ✅ (now configured)
4. **Create `dist/` folder** ✅ (will be generated)
5. **Deploy successfully** ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deployment
If you already set up GitHub integration, Cloudflare should detect the new commit and automatically retry the deployment.

### Option 2: Trigger Manual Deployment
If auto-deployment doesn't trigger:
1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Pages**
2. Find your **workflowmax-dashboard** project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"Create deployment"**
5. Select **"Production"** branch: **main**

### Option 3: Re-setup GitHub Integration
If needed, you can reconnect:
1. **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Pages** → **"Create application"**
2. **"Connect to Git"** → **GitHub**
3. Select **"Stephen-Pillar3/workflowmax-dashboard"**
4. **Build settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect from wrangler.jsonc)
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
   - **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)

## ✅ Expected Success

With the fixed configuration, you should see:
```
✅ Cloning repository...
✅ Running npm install...
✅ Running npm run build...
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ dist/ folder created with _worker.js
✅ Deployment successful
```

## 🌐 Live URLs (After Successful Deployment)

- **Production**: `https://workflowmax-dashboard.pages.dev`
- **API Health**: `https://workflowmax-dashboard.pages.dev/api/health`  
- **Dashboard**: `https://workflowmax-dashboard.pages.dev`

## 🔍 Verify Deployment Success

Test these endpoints after deployment:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://workflowmax-dashboard.pages.dev/api/health

# Should return:
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","version":"3.0.0","environment":"production"}

# Dashboard analytics
curl https://workflowmax-dashboard.pages.dev/api/dashboard/analytics

# Should return YTD and monthly data
```

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check build logs** in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. **Verify Node.js version** (should use Node 18+)
3. **Check for missing dependencies** 
4. **Try manual deployment** with `dist` folder upload

The configuration is now correct, so the deployment should succeed! 🎉
